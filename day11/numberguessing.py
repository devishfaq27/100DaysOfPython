#TODO-2: Ask the user to guess the number.
#TODO-3: If the guess is correct, congratulate them and end the game.
#TODO-4: If the guess is too high, print "Too high!" and let them guess again.
#TODO-5: If the guess is too low, print "Too low!" and let them guess again.
#TODO-6: Add a limit to the number of guesses they can make (like 5 or 10 tries).
#TODO-7: At the end, reveal the correct number if they didnâ€™t guess it.
