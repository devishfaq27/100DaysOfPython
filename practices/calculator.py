#           Project: Simple Calculator
#TODO- Define a function add that takes two numbers and returns their sum.
#TODO- Define a function subtract that takes two numbers and returns the difference.
#TODO- Define a function multiply that takes two numbers and returns their product.
#TODO- Define a function divide that takes two numbers and returns their quotient.
#TODO- Create a main function that:
#TODO- Asks the user to pick an operation: add, subtract, multiply, or divide.
#TODO- Asks the user for two numbers.
#TODO- Calls the appropriate function based on the userâ€™s choice.
#TODO- Prints the result.
#TODO- Add a loop to keep asking the user if they want to perform another calculation until they choose to quit.
